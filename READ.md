# Space Exploration Quiz

## Objective
The aim of this project is to create an interactive quiz that tests users' knowledge about space exploration. The quiz provides immediate feedback to the user and displays a final score upon completion. It also uses a simple authentication system to start the quiz.

## Breakdown and Marking Scheme
1. **Basic HTML Setup (10 marks)**:
    - Creation of the quiz structure using semantic HTML.
    - Use of forms for quiz questions and answer options.

2. **Styling with CSS (20 marks)**:
    - Consistent styling for the quiz interface.
    - Visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers (e.g., color changes).

3. **JavaScript Interactivity (40 marks)**:
    - Use of JavaScript for quiz logic (question display, answer checking, score tallying).
    - Implementation of "fake" authentication with JavaScript variables to start the quiz.
    - Immediate feedback provided to user selections.

4. **Documentation and Reflection (15 marks)**:
    - Well-documented code with comments explaining key JavaScript functions.
    - A README file discussing the implementation and any challenges faced.

5. **Advanced Features and Creativity (15 marks)**:
    - Addition of a progress bar or question counter.

## Implementation
The quiz consists of five questions on space exploration. Users must enter a username to start the quiz. Each question is displayed one at a time, and users receive immediate feedback on their answers. Correct answers are highlighted in green, while incorrect answers are highlighted in red. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed.

### Challenges Faced
- Implementing the fake authentication system to start the quiz.
- Providing immediate feedback for correct and incorrect answers.
- Ensuring the quiz logic correctly tallies the score and progresses through the questions.

### Future Improvements
- Adding more questions to the quiz.
- Implementing a timer for each question.
- Providing detailed explanations for each answer after the quiz is completed.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a username and click "Start Quiz".
3. Answer the questions and click "Next Question" to proceed.
4. View your score at the end of the quiz.
